# Sparta
Our bot, SPARTA, has been designed with university students in mind. It intends to capture information about people playing a sport or planning to play a sport and treats it as an event; thereby making it possible for more people to join the existing players. SPARTA, is location and sport specific, which means that itâ€™s database identifies a list of locations at NTU, specifically curated by the designers as well as a list of most commonly  played sports.

The bot has been deployed on Heroku and is functional on telegram. To test our bot, click this link on Telegram:
